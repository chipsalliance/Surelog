Deprecated Features

A deprecated feature is one whose use is no longer recommended.  These
are features that are no longer needed or whose functionality has been
replaced by another feature.  Features can become deprecated for a number
of reasons usually having to do with improving the use models of OVM.

Rather than immediately removing features that are no longer needed we
have instituted a deprecation policy to ease the transition from old to
new.  When a feature is no longer needed we will identify it as
"deprecated" in this file shipped with the release.  We will keep
deprecated features in subsequent releases as long as necessary to allow
OVM users to move to the new recommended features.  Obscure features
will be removed in as short as one release cycle, features which many
people are using may remain in OVM through a number of release cycles.
The exact length of time that a deprecated item will stay in OVM depends
on what we hear from users.  Through this policy we preserve backward
compatibility while still enabling improvements in OVM.

The following list of features is deprecated.  We recommend that you do
not use these features.  If you are, begin transitioning your code away
from these features. It is likely they will be removed from future OVM
release.

Global Variables
----------------

ovm_test_top

    Used to point to the instance of the top-level test in cases where the test
    was specified on the command line or via an argument to run_test(), this
    handle to an ovm_component-based object has been moved out of global space
    and is no longer user-visible.

   The object is available using ovm_top.get_child("ovm_test_top");

    Deprecated in OVM 1.1


ovm_component ovm_top_levels[$];

    Used as an internal variable in global space to hold a list of top-level
    components with no parent, it is replaced by the existence of ovm_top, which
    serves as the parent for such components.

    The top levels can be found by scanning the children of ovm_top,
    using:

      string c;
      ovm_component cmp;
      if(ovm_top.get_first_child(c))
      do begin
        cmp = ovm_top.get_child(c);
        //do action on cmp
      end while(ovm_top.get_next_child(c));

    Deprecated in OVM 1.1
  

`ovm_phase_func_decl(post_new,0), 
`ovm_phase_func_decl(export_connections,0)
`ovm_phase_func_decl(import_connections,1)
`ovm_phase_func_decl(pre_run,0)
`ovm_phase_func_decl(configure,0)

post_new_ph
export_connections_ph
import_connections_phase
configure_ph
pre_run_ph

    The post_new() phase is replaced by the build() phase.

    The import_connections(), connect(), and export connection() phases are
    reduced to a single connect() phase. Connection resolution via 
    resolve_bindings() allows connections to be order-independent; multiple
    connection phases are therefore unnecessary.

    The configure() phase has been replaced by end_of_elaboration() phase.

    The pre_run() phase is replaced by the start_of_simulation() phase.

    The phase objects are likewise replaced with their counterparts,
    e.g., you should use the build_ph object instead of the post_new_ph
    object when you need the explicit phase object.

    Deprecated in OVM 1.1


Global Functions
----------------

ovm_find_component

    Replaced by ovm_top.find(comp_name).

    Deprecated in OVM 1.1


ovm_print_topology

    Replaced by ovm_top.print_topology.

    Deprecated in OVM 1.1


avm_report_message
avm_report_warning
avm_report_error
avm_report_fatal

    The avm-prefixed global functions are replaced by ovm-prefixed methods.

    Deprecated in OVM 1.1


_global_reporter

    The global reporter was created in order for modules or other
    objects not derived from ovm_report_object to use report functions.
    This funcitonality is now available using ovm_top and so the global
    reporter is no longer necessary.


Classes
-------

ovm_threaded_component

    All of the features of ovm_threaded_component have been folded into
    ovm_component.  In 2.0, ovm_threaded_component is available as a typedef
    of ovm_component.

    Deprecated in OVM 2.0


Methods
-------

ovm_object::do_sprint

    This method (in conjunction with sprint()) was intended as a replacement 
    for the AVM convert2string() method, but was never implemented. However,
    sprint() was designed to use the ovm_printer policy and is therefore
    unsuitable as a simple string conversion method. convert2string() has
    been promoted to the ovm_object class and has been removed from the
    deprecation list. For simple string conversions that do not want/need the
    ovm_printer policies, ovm_object::convert2string() should be used.

    Deprecated in OVM 2.0.3


ovm_root::print_unit_list
ovm_root::print_unit
ovm_root::print_units

    These methods, originally static methods in ovm_component, were moved to
    ovm_root (accessible via ovm_top.<method>) and deprecated.

    Deprecated in OVM 1.1


ovm_env::do_test
ovm_env::m_do_test_mode
ovm_env::do_task_phase
ovm_env::run 

    The methods and variables used to support the do_test mode are
    deprecated in favor of the ovm_top.run_test semantics. 

    Deprecated in OVM 1.1


ovm_report_object::avm_report_message
ovm_report_object::avm_report_warning
ovm_report_object::avm_report_error
ovm_report_object::avm_report_fatal

    The avm-prefixed methods are replaced by like-named ovm-prefixed
    methods. The avm_report_message method is replaced by ovm_report_info.

    Deprecated in OVM 1.1


ovm_sequence_item::set_parent_seq
ovm_sequence_item::get_parent_seq

    These methods are replaced by the more descriptive
    set_parent_sequence and get_parent_sequence

    Deprecated in OVM 2.0


ovm_sequence_item::pre_do
ovm_sequence_item::body
ovm_sequence_item::mid_do
ovm_sequence_item::post_do
ovm_sequence_item::wait_for_grant
ovm_sequence_item::send_request
ovm_sequence_item::wait_for_item_done

    These methods were simply moved to ovm_sequence_base, which
    is a more appropriate location for sequence-related
    functionality.

    Moved in OVM 2.0


ovm_sequencer_base::start_sequence

    By deprecating this method, the only means of starting a sequence
    is via the start() task. Users needing to start a sequence without
    blocking can simply call:
    
      fork some_sequencer.start(some_sequence); join_none

    Deprecated in OVM 2.0


Macros
------

`OVM_REPORT_INFO
`OVM_REPORT_WARNING
`OVM_REPORT_ERROR
`OVM_REPORT_FATAL

    These macros have been replaced by the macros `ovm_info, `ovm_warning,
    `ovm_error and `ovm_fatal respectively. The new macros test that a message
    is to be emitted before calling the underlying ovm_report_* method. 
    Furthermore, the new macros add file and line information if enabled.

    Deprecated in OVM 2.0.3

Removed Features

The following features in previous releases have been removed.

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_


Classes
-------

ovm_seq_prod_if
ovm_seq_cons_if
ovm_seq_item_prod_if
ovm_seq_item_cons_if

    The ovm_seq_*_if classes are no longer necessary to create a
    sequencer/driver connection.  Instead, use ovm_seq_item_pull_port#() in
    the driver and ovm_seq_item_pull_export#() in the sequencer to form this
    connection.

    Deprecated in OVM 2.0


virtual_sequencer

    Since sequences can be started directly on sequencers, virtual
    sequencers are no longer necessary. 

    Deprecated in OVM 2.0


ovm_scenario
ovm_scenario_controller
ovm_scenario_driver

    The scenarios facility has been replaced by the new sequences facility.

    Deprecated in OVM 2.0


Methods
-------

ovm_component::check_connection_size

    This is replaced by the internal method, resolve_bindings(), which is called
    automatically just before the end_of_elaboration phase. 


ovm_component::do_display

    Display of component state is handled by the print() method.


ovm_component::absolute_lookup
ovm_component::relative_lookup

    Replaced by lookup(). If the instance path string that is passed to lookup()
    begins with a '.', the instance path is deemed absolute, otherwise it is
    considered relative to the component.


ovm_component::find_component
ovm_component::find_components

    Replaced by ovm_top.find() and ovm_top.find_all(), which have the same
    prototypes and functionality.


ovm_component::get_num_components
ovm_component::get_component

    These were used internally for component searches and were not meant for
    end-users. The ovm_top's find, find_all, and ovm_component's lookup method
    provide similar functionality.


ovm_component::do_set_env
ovm_component::m_env
ovm_component::ovm_env m_env (static)

    Replaced by ovm_top. 


ovm_component::add_to_debug_list
ovm_component::build_debug_lists
ovm_component::m_components
ovm_component::m_ports
ovm_component::m_exports
ovm_component::m_implementations

    These debug methods, originally from AVM, can be replaced by simple
    procedures that iterate over a component's children. For ports, exports,
    and implementations, there are the debug_connected_to and debug_provided_to
    methods, which have been enhanced a great deal in OVM 2.0.


ovm_report_object::ovm_report_message
ovm_report_object::avm_report_message
ovm_report_object::report_message_hook

    These are replaced by ovm_report_info and report_info_hook.
