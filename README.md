# Surelog

SystemVerilog 2017 Pre-processor, Parser, Elaborator, UHDM Compiler. Provides IEEE Design/TB C/C++ VPI and Python AST API. 

## Goal
This project aims at providing a complete SystemVerilog 2017 front-end: a preprocessor, a parser, an elaborator for both design and testbench. We are aiming at supporting all open-source cores.
* Current status: 
   * Surelog's elaboration trees for [BlackParrot](https://github.com/black-parrot/black-parrot), [Ariane](https://github.com/lowRISC/ariane) and [Earlgrey](https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan) cores are equivalent with Verilator's elaboration tree. 
   * [Ibex](https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex) completely Synthesizes and runs in Hardware with the Surelog/UHDM/Yosys flow. 

## Applications

Linter, Simulator, Synthesis tool, Formal tools can use this front-end. They either can be developed as plugins (linked with) or use this front-end as an intermediate step of their compilation flows using the on-disk serialized models (UHDM).

## Contributing to this project

This project is open to contributions from any users! From the commercial vendor to the Verilog enthousiast, all are welcome.
We started maintaning a list of ideas for contribution under [Help Wanted](https://github.com/alainmarcel/Help_Wanted)

## Features

 * The preprocessor and the parser use Antlr 4.72 as a parser generator.
 * The preprocessor and the parser ASTs are made persistent on disk using Google Flatbuffers, enabling incremental compilation.
 * The tool is built thread safe and performs multithread parsing.
 * Large files/modules/packages are splitted for multi-threading compilation.
 * Surelog accepts IEEE Simulator-compliant project specification.
 * Surelog issues Errors/Warning/Info/Notes about language compliance.
 * Surelog allows for pre-compiled packages (UVM,...).
 * A comprehensive Python API allows to:
    * listen or visit the Parser grammar and create custom linting rules
    * Visit the design data model and create custom linting rules
    * Customize the message formats
    * Waive messages
 * Surelog creates a [UHDM](https://github.com/alainmarcel/UHDM/) compiled database of the design that can be read by 3rd party tools (Synthesis, Simulator, Linter, Formal...) using the Standard VPI API.

## Build instructions and test:

 * Read [`INSTALL`](INSTALL.md)

```bash
  make
or
  make debug
or
  make release_no_tcmalloc (For no tcmalloc)
make install (/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/surelog by default, use DESTDIR= for alternative locations. Note: do not use PREFIX=)
```

For more build/test options and system requirements for building see
[`src/README`](src/README.md) file.

## Use Surelog as an external package with CMake

For your project to use Surelog as an external module, you need to tell CMake where to find Surelog. Note that CMake expects the module directory organized a certain way and Surelog's installation step does that so make sure to run that. You can provide the path to CMake in few different ways -

1. By updating `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` variable in your project's CMakeLists.txt file by adding the following lines -

```
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} <absolute or relative path to surelog installation folder>)
find_package(Surelog)
```

2. By providing the location of the surelog installation with the `find_package` command itself, as in the following -
```
find_package(Surelog PATHS <absolute or relative path to surelog installation folder>)
```

3. By providing the location of the surelog installation as a command line parameter when invoking CMake -
```
cmake -DSurelog_DIR=<absolute or relative path to surelog installation folder> -S . -B out
```

For additional help, refer to cmake documentation on external modules.

Once CMake successfully finds Surelog, all you would need is to add the following line after the call to `add_library/add_executable` in your CMakeLists.txt file.
```
target_link_libraries(<your project name> surelog)
```

### C++ API

 * Surelog comes in the form of a library libsurelog.a and can be linked to an executalble.
 * Extensive API is provided to browse:
   * the preprocessor file contents in AST form,
   * the post-parsing file contents in AST form,
   * the non-elaborated and elaborated design/testbench data model.
   * the UHDM or IEEE VPI Object Model.
 * Creating your own executable using libsurelog.a is discussed in [`src/README`](src/README.md) file.
 * Two examples executable file (hellosureworld.cpp and hellouhdm.cpp) illustrate how to navigate the Surelog internal data structure or the UHDM "VPI Standard Object Model" of the design using the libsurelog.a library.

### Python API

 * By default Surelog does not build the Python API, See  [`src/README`](src/README.md) 
 * The file [`slformatmsg.py`](src/API/slformatmsg.py) illustrates how messages can be reformated.
   * Place a modified version of this file either in the execution directory, or install directory /usr/local/lib/surelog/python

 * The file [`src/API/slSV3_1aPythonListener.py`](src/API/slSV3_1aPythonListener.py) illustrates how a listener can be created to listen to the Parser AST.
   * Place a modified version of this file either in the execution directory, or install directory /usr/local/lib/surelog/python

 * A simple example of creating a new error message and generating errors can be found here: [`python_listener.py`](src/API/python_listener.py)

 * A simple example for design-level data model exploration can be found here: [`myscriptPerDesign.py`](tests/UnitPython/myscriptPerDesign.py)

 * The complete Python API is described in the following files: [`SLAPI.h`](src/API/SLAPI.h) [`vobjecttypes`](src/API/vobjecttypes.py)

 * Waivers can be installed in slwaivers.py files in the execution directory or install directory /usr/local/lib/surelog/python

### Large design compilation on Linux
 * It is recommanded to use the -lowmem -mp <nb processor> options in conjunction for large designs.
 * The preprocessing will occur using one process, but the parsing will occur using multiple processes.
 * The elaboration and UHDM creation will use a single process.
 * Surelog spawns sub-Surelog processes to achieve the overall compilation.
 * Or course don't use the -nocache option to benefit from incremental compilation and reuse cached parsed files 

### Batch mode operations

  * A utility script [`tests/create_batch_script.tcl`](tests/create_batch_script.tcl) generates batch command files for large unit test regressions. See the script's internal help.
